# Light Up Game Recreation

## Description
This project is a recreation of the classic puzzle game Light Up, also known as Akari, developed using Java and JavaFX. It implements the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern to separate the game logic, user interface, and data handling for an efficient and maintainable codebase.

## Features
- Graphical User Interface: Developed using JavaFX for an intuitive user experience.
- Multiple Puzzles Levels: Catering to both beginners and advanced players.

## Light Up Rules
- Place bulbs on the grid to illuminate all the empty squares
- A numbered square indicates how many bulbs should be adjacent to it, either horizontally or vertically.
- Bulbs cannot illuminate each other.
